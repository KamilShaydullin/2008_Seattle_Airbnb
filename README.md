# In this notebook I analyze 2008 Seattle AirBnb data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:
- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

I analysed the following:
- Geospatial data
- Pricing
- Review scores
- Host cancellations
- Availability
- Important hosts and guests

## Based on the analysis I came with a few recommendations that would add value to the business.

To supplement my analysis I also used:
 - Seattle poverty data data from https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3ee2c37817454b9089e8c4d73a43c2f2_0/explore
 - Geodata of the goegraphical boundaries of Seattle from https://github.com/seattleio/seattle-boundaries-data/blob/master/data/city-limits.geojson
