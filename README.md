In this notebook I analyze 2008 Seattle AirBnb data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data.

Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

Content
The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:
Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day


As a result of the analysis I came with some recommendations that would improve the business.
